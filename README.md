# Alzheimer's Detection using Hybrid Approach

This is my final project for UoL, using the Deep Learning on a public dataset template.

In this project I attempt to evaluate whether using a hybrid approach of using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) 
for feature extraction and then using the extracted features in a classifier model (e.g. KNN) would yield comparable results 
to using a trained CNN.
